### About me
Hello! I started programming back in 2021 and was immediately hooked. After spending some time self learning, I started my degree path of software developement and security with a minor in cyber security, which is expected in May of 2024. While on the journey of getting my degree, I started to grow my family with my husband with our two cats and our kiddo and eventually medically retired from the Army. I am excited to keep learning and growing in my field and see what all I am able to accomplish!

### Goals for this course:
- Learning about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- Deploy a live, functioning application
- Learn more about front end features
- Be able to implement different things that I have learned previously to a full stack development
