  "Hello! I am currently finishing my degree in Software Development and Security with a minor in CyberSecurity \
  while also continuing my education at SavvyCoders doing the Full Stack Development boot camp.I am wanting to continue \
  to learn and expand my knowledge to create fun and exciting user experiences while validating the security of \
  an application. I first started my journey in programming in 2021 and after creating my first script in Python and \
  seeing it run, I was hooked! I enjoy the challenges that I am faced while programming and learning more about how to \
  solve them. I'm more than excited to see where this journey takes me.";
